<h1 align= "center"> ParkMe: A Parking Reservation Application </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> The first thing that a driver should consider when driving is parking, and finding a place to park in a certain place can take a lot of time, especially in the cities. These parking spaces that are difficult to discover, expensive or inadequate have a tendency to frustrate drivers. Dealing with the street-side parking, the sidewalks are compromised and create problems. With the cause of parking in an inappropriate place, this can result in three situations: theft, an increase in traffic congestion, and frustration for a lot of drivers. Aiming to solve this problem, the implementation of the Parking Reservation App in a city is essential. This app will let drivers make a reservation for a parking space in a different area at anytime, anywhere. </p>


<h2> Purpose and Description </h2>
<p>Parking takes a significant amount of time because spots are hard to find. There are locations that offer parking spaces, however they are pricey and insufficient. On the other hand, streetside parking has various issues that make it less effective. Accidents frequently result from parking in inappropriate locations. These issues with parking places are generally addressed by the introduction of the Parking Reservation App. </p>
<p>Drivers may use the application to reserve a parking spot whenever and wherever it is convenient for them. By decreasing the amount of time spent manually searching for parking spaces across Batangas City, the PARKME Reservation App seeks to put its service into action. As soon as a driver selects a parking place, the payment is made online, which is a significant convenience for both drivers and parking administration. The amount of time it takes to serve a user is significantly reduced as a result of its online interactions. Additionally, the parking management side would find it simpler and safer to maintain the information pertaining to their client.</p>
<p>To develop a mobile application that will enable drivers to locate and reserve a parking space online.</p>
<p>To establish possible solutions to the problem of finding a parking space in different areas that unnecessarily consumes time.</p>
<p>To reduce oil consumption and air pollution.</p>
<p>To provide a more convenient life for the society.</p>


<h2> Scope </h2>
<p>The project focuses on how we can help the Batangas City community by allowing drivers to view different parking spaces and select specific places to see if a parking space is available or not.  We will also be able to deliver more convenience to the drivers with the help of our application. Our team developed Parkner, an app for drivers who struggle and waste their time looking for the best and safe parking area of their vehicles. We've provided a simple user interface that everyone may use. We test these applications after it is finalized to ensure that they are functional and accessible.

<h2> Significance of the Proposed Project </h2>
<p>Drivers want to choose their ideal parking spot. The Parking Reservation Application uses real-time data and apps to keep users informed about available and unavailable parking spots. The aim was to implement the process and cut down on time spent manually looking for the ideal parking spot in Batangas City. For both drivers and parking management, the application will be a lot faster and easier. Because even the payment is done online, the time it takes to serve a user is greatly decreased. On the parking management side, this technology will assist them in keeping their data more secure such as customer information. Together with parking regulation, implementing a parking reservation solution would surely be a great investment for areas in Batangas City. If you download the app, you will be prompted to register your name before proceeding to the following screen, where you will select a time and day for booking an available parking space in a specific area.
