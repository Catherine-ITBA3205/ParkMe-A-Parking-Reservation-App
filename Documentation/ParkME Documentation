AGILE METHODOLOGY

The system was developed using the Agile Development Model. The developers chose this model because they think it could result in
a higher-quality end product since it gives them better insight into project performance by letting team members understand how the 
project is progressing and giving them more opportunity to test, change, and adapt throughout the process to what would be best for the project.

Strategy and Planning – In this phase, the team will check the current state and your expectations will be determined through an assessment of 
concepts and requirements description.

Design – In this phase, the team will set up the equipment necessary to maximize productivity.

Development and Programming – The team will start creating the code during this phase. The engagement and input of the end users are 
essential from the very start of the process.

Beta Testing and Review - sprint-based frequent delivery of program software. Feedback on testing and any adjustments are essential. 

Site Launch – After testing, the mobile application will be made available for use by the user.
