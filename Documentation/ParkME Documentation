Project Description
Parking takes a lot of time as parking spaces are difficult to discover. There are places that provide parking spaces but are expensive and inadequate. 
Streetside parking, on the other hand, is not totally efficient as some problems arise with it. With the cause of parking in inappropriate places, accidents 
tend to occur. The implementation of the Parking Reservation App tends to cater to these problems being faced with regard to parking spaces. The application
would let drivers reserve a parking space that is convenient for them at anytime, anywhere. The Parking Reservation App aims to implement its service by cutting 
down the time spent on manually looking for parking spots throughout Batangas City. The application would be of great service to both drivers and parking 
management as the payment would be done online as soon as the driver chose a parking space. Due to its online interactions, the time it takes to serve a user 
is greatly decreased. The parking management side would also be able to store the data about their customers' information more easily and securely. Along with 
the parking regulations, the implementation of a parking reservation solution would be a great improvement for parking areas in Batangas City.

AGILE METHODOLOGY

The system was developed using the Agile Development Model. The developers chose this model because they think it could result in
a higher-quality end product since it gives them better insight into project performance by letting team members understand how the 
project is progressing and giving them more opportunity to test, change, and adapt throughout the process to what would be best for the project.

Strategy and Planning – In this phase, the team will check the current state and your expectations will be determined through an assessment of 
concepts and requirements description.

Design – In this phase, the team will set up the equipment necessary to maximize productivity.

Development and Programming – The team will start creating the code during this phase. The engagement and input of the end users are 
essential from the very start of the process.

Beta Testing and Review - sprint-based frequent delivery of program software. Feedback on testing and any adjustments are essential. 

Site Launch – After testing, the mobile application will be made available for use by the user.

The following diagrams are provided by the team to demonstrate how users interact with the application. 
It displays that a user may book a parking space in advance so that they won't bother other vehicles and can save time for themselves.

Another feature is that the app itself allows the user to pay for the parking space.
